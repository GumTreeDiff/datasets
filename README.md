# Diff datasets

A collection of diff datasets. It contains:

- [GitHub Java](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/datasets/tree/main/gh-java) which is a Java dataset containing 10000 commits from 10 popular projects.
  [GitHub Python](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/datasets/tree/main/gh-python) which is a Python dataset containing 10000 commits from 10 popular projects.
- [Defects4J](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/datasets/tree/main/defects4j) which is a Java dataset used in the program repair community. The `buggy` folder contains the files containing the defect and the `fixed` folder contains the fixed files.
- [BugsInPy](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/datasets/tree/main/bugsinpy) which is a Python dataset used in the program repair community. Its layout is similar to Defects4J's one.
- [unparsable](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/datasets/tree/main/unparsable) which contains the diff cases for which we could not parse one of the files.

The Python scripts used to produce the datasets are also provided.
