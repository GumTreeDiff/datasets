/**
 * <p>This interface defines a future that has listeners attached to it, which

 * executor, and is invoked using this executor once the {@code Future}'s
 * computation is {@linkplain Future#isDone() complete}.  The listener will be
 * executed even if it is added after the computation is complete.
 *
 * <p>Usage:
 * <pre>   {@code
 *   final ListenableFuture<?> future = myService.async(myRequest);
 *   future.addListener(new Runnable() {
 *     public void run() {
 *       System.out.println("Operation Complete.");
 *       try {
 *         System.out.println("Result: " + future.get());
 *       } catch (Exception e) {
 *         System.out.println("Error: " + e.message());
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }, exec);}</pre>
 *
 * @param <V> The type returned by {@link Future#get()}.
